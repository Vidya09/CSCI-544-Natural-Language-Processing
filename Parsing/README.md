# PARSING

The aim of this homework is to build a simple constituency parser trained from the ATIS portion of the Penn Treebank.

The three parts of this homework are as follows:
1. Writing code to learn a probabilistic CFG from trees.
2. Write a CYK parser that takes the grammar and a sentence as input, and outputs the highest-probability parse.
3. Make at least three modifications to try to improve the accuracy of the parser.
