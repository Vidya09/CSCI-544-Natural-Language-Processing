# Vector Similarity

This homework involves implementing comparison functions for word representations and using the functions and representations to solve semantic similarity tasks.

The several parts of this homework are as follows:
1. Determine the cosine similarity of words given context vector counts of the words.
2. Given a dictionary of word-context vectors, the context vector of a particular query word 'w', the words you want to exclude in the responses (It should be the query word w in this question), find the 10 words most similar to 'w' using cosine similarity.
3. Explore cosine similarity for words represented by their word embedding vectors pretrained by Word2Vec.
4. Perform analogical reasoning tasks with word vectors.
