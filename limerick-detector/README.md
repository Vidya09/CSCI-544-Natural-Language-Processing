A limerick is defined as a poem with the form AABBA, where the A lines rhyme with each other, the B lines rhyme with each other, and the A lines do not rhyme with the B lines.

Additionally, the following syllable constraints should be observed:
 * No two A lines should differ in their number of syllables by more than two.
 * The B lines should differ in their number of syllables by no more than two.
 * Each of the B lines should have fewer syllables than each of the A lines.
 * No line should have fewer than 4 syllables
