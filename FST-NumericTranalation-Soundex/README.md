# Finite State Adventures, Census Nomenclature, Number Translation, and a Little Light Morphology

This goal of this homework is to create Finite State Transducers in python to solve the follwing three problems:

1. Soundex - Implement the Soundex algorithm to detect names with the same sound in English. </br>
2. Numeric Translation - Construct an FST in NLTK that can translate an Arabic numeral (between 0 and 1000) into its        corresponding French string. </br>
3. Morphology - Implement additional regular expression rules that will correctly handle c/ck alternations. </br>
